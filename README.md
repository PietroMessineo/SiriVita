SiriVita
========

Here you can find all of the file needed to run or translate the Italian Porting of Siri "SiriVita".
In this repo I have hosted, the command list that works on iOS 5.0.1/5.1.5 and a lot of plugins in .py updated at the last available version.
The plugins are in .py and you can use it only for private purpose, not for profit.
